### *** Two Pointer ***
##Valid Palindrome
'''
Write a function that takes a string s as input and checks whether it’s a palindrome or not.
Flow: 
- Initialize two pointers and traverse them towards the middle of the string.
- Check if the current pair of elements is identical or not.
- If they are not identical, return False, else, move both pointers by one index toward the middle.
- If we reach the middle of the string without finding a mismatch, return True.
Naive approach: reverse the string and then compare the reversed string with the original string. This, despite being a solution of linear time complexity, will still occupy extra space, and we can use an optimized approach to save extra space.  
Optimized approach: We initialize two pointers and move them from opposite ends. The first pointer starts moving toward the middle from the start of our string, while the second pointer starts moving toward the middle from the end of our string. This allows us to compare these elements at every single instance to find a non-matching pair, and if they reach the middle of the string without encountering any non-matching pair, that means we indeed traverse a palindrome.

##Sum of Three Values
'''
Given an array of integers, nums, and an integer value, target, determine if there are any three integers in nums whose sum is equal to the target, that is, nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == target. Return TRUE if three such integers exist in the array. Otherwise, return FALSE.
Flow: 
- Sort the input array in ascending order.
- Iterate over the entire sorted array to find the triplet whose sum is equal to the target.
- In each iteration, make a triplet by storing the current array element and the other two elements using two pointers (low and high), and calculate their sum.
-Adjust the calculated sum value, until it becomes equal to the target value, by conditionally moving the pointers, low and high.
- Return TRUE if the required sum is found. Otherwise, return FALSE.
Naive approach: The naive approach to solving this problem is to use three nested loops. Each nested loop starts at the index greater than its parent loop. O(n^3) - O(1).
Optimized approach: First, sort the array in ascending order. To find a triplet whose sum is equal to the target value, loop through the entire array. In each iteration:
Store the current array element and set up two pointers (low and high) to find the other two elements that complete the required triplet.
The low pointer is set to the current loop’s index + 1.
The high is set to the last index of the array.
Calculate the sum of array elements pointed to by the current loop’s index and the low and high pointers.
If the sum is equal to target, return TRUE.
If the sum is less than target, move the low pointer forward.
If the sum is greater than target, move the high pointer backward.
Repeat until the loop has processed the entire array. If, after processing the entire array, we don’t find any triplet that matches our requirement, we return FALSE.
Sort = O(nlog(n)) | nested loop = O(n^2) = O(nlog(n) + n^2) = O(n^2) || built-in sort space: O(n)
