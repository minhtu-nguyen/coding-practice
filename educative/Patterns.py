### *** Two Pointer ***
'''
As the name suggests, the two pointers pattern uses two pointers to iterate over an array or list until the conditions of the problem are satisfied. This is useful because it allows us to keep track of the values of two different indexes in a single iteration. Whenever there’s a requirement to find two data elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition, the two pointers pattern should be the first strategy to come to mind.
'''
##Valid Palindrome
'''
Write a function that takes a string s as input and checks whether it’s a palindrome or not.
Flow: 
- Initialize two pointers and traverse them towards the middle of the string.
- Check if the current pair of elements is identical or not.
- If they are not identical, return False, else, move both pointers by one index toward the middle.
- If we reach the middle of the string without finding a mismatch, return True.
Naive approach: reverse the string and then compare the reversed string with the original string. This, despite being a solution of linear time complexity, will still occupy extra space, and we can use an optimized approach to save extra space.  
Optimized approach: We initialize two pointers and move them from opposite ends. The first pointer starts moving toward the middle from the start of our string, while the second pointer starts moving toward the middle from the end of our string. This allows us to compare these elements at every single instance to find a non-matching pair, and if they reach the middle of the string without encountering any non-matching pair, that means we indeed traverse a palindrome.

##Sum of Three Values
'''
Given an array of integers, nums, and an integer value, target, determine if there are any three integers in nums whose sum is equal to the target, that is, nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == target. Return TRUE if three such integers exist in the array. Otherwise, return FALSE.
Flow: 
- Sort the input array in ascending order.
- Iterate over the entire sorted array to find the triplet whose sum is equal to the target.
- In each iteration, make a triplet by storing the current array element and the other two elements using two pointers (low and high), and calculate their sum.
-Adjust the calculated sum value, until it becomes equal to the target value, by conditionally moving the pointers, low and high.
- Return TRUE if the required sum is found. Otherwise, return FALSE.
Naive approach: The naive approach to solving this problem is to use three nested loops. Each nested loop starts at the index greater than its parent loop. O(n^3) - O(1).
Optimized approach: First, sort the array in ascending order. To find a triplet whose sum is equal to the target value, loop through the entire array. In each iteration:
Store the current array element and set up two pointers (low and high) to find the other two elements that complete the required triplet.
The low pointer is set to the current loop’s index + 1.
The high is set to the last index of the array.
Calculate the sum of array elements pointed to by the current loop’s index and the low and high pointers.
If the sum is equal to target, return TRUE.
If the sum is less than target, move the low pointer forward.
If the sum is greater than target, move the high pointer backward.
Repeat until the loop has processed the entire array. If, after processing the entire array, we don’t find any triplet that matches our requirement, we return FALSE.

##Reverse Words in a String
'''
Given a sentence, reverse the order of its words without affecting the order of letters within a given word.
Flow: 
- Reverse the entire string.
- Start iterating over the reversed string using two pointers, start and end, initially set at 0.
- While iterating over the string, reverse a word pointed by start and end pointers, when a space is found.
- Once the word has been reversed, update the start and end pointer to the index of the space + 1.
- Repeat the process until the entire string is iterated and return the string.
O(n+n)=O(n) | O(n) - copy it into a list of characters to overcome the issue of strings being immutable in Python

                         "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog   ",
                         "Hey", "To be or not to be",
                         "AAAAA","Hello     World"]

import re
def reverse_words(sentence):
   # remove leading, trailing and multiple spaces
   sentence = re.sub(' +',' ',sentence.strip())
   # We need to convert the updated string
   # to lists of characters as strings are immutable in Python
   sentence = list(sentence)
   str_len = len(sentence)
   
   #  We will first reverse the entire string.
   str_rev(sentence, 0, str_len - 1)
   #  Now all the words are in the desired location, but

### *** Fast and Slow
'''
Unlike the two pointers approach, which is concerned with data values, the fast and slow pointers approach is used to determine data structure traits using indices in arrays or node pointers in linked lists. The approach is commonly used to detect cycles in the given data structure, so it’s also known as Floyd’s cycle detection algorithm.
'''
##Happy Number
'''
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

- A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
- Return TRUE if n is a happy number, and FALSE if not.
Flow: 
- Initialise a variable slow with the input number and fast with the squared sum of the input number’s digits.
- If fast is not 1 and also not equal to slow, increment slow by one iteration and fast by two iterations. Essentially, set slow to Sum of Digits(slow) and fast to Sum of Digits(Sum of Digits(fast)).
- If fast converges to 1, return TRUE, otherwise return FALSE.
Naive approach: The brute force approach is to repeatedly calculate the squared sum of digits of the input number and store the computed sum in a hash set. For every calculation, we check if the sum is already present in the set. If yes, we've detected a cycle and should return FALSE. Otherwise, we add it to our hash set and continue further. If our sum converges to, we've found a happy number. O(logn) | O(n)
Optimized approach: We maintain track of two values using a slow pointer and a fast pointer. The slow runner advances one number at each step, while the fast runner advances two numbers. We detect if there is any cycle by comparing the two values and checking if the fast runner has indeed reached the number one. We return True or False depending on if those conditions are met. 2 pointers = O(logn+logn) = O(logn) | O(1)
    inputs = [1, 5, 19, 25, 7]

            number, digit = divmod(number, 10)
            total_sum += digit ** 2
        return total_sum

    slow_pointer = n 
    fast_pointer = sum_of_squared_digits(n)  

    while fast_pointer != 1 and slow_pointer != fast_pointer: 
        slow_pointer = sum_of_squared_digits(slow_pointer)

### *** Practice
## 2 pointers - Valid Palindrome II
'''
Write a function that takes a string as input and checks whether it can be a valid palindrome by removing at most one character from it.
Flow: 
- Initialize two pointers at opposite ends of the string.
- If the values at the left and right indexes match, move both toward the middle until they meet.
- If a mismatch occurs, skip one of the elements and check the rest of the string for a palindrome.
- Skip the other element, and check for the palindrome.
- If no palindrome is obtained, return False, else if no more than one mismatch occurs throughout the traversal, return True.
