### Variables and Types
## Numbers
myint = 7
myfloat = 7.0
myfloat = float(7)
## Strings
mystring = 'hello'
mystring = "hello"  
mystring = "Don't worry about apostrophes" 
# Simple operators can be executed on numbers and strings:
one = 1
two = 2
three = one + two
hello = "hello"
world = "world"
helloworld = hello + " " + world
# Assignments can be done "simultaneously" 
a, b = 3, 4
# Mixing operators between numbers and strings is not supported
# Casting
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
# Get the Type
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
# Variable names are case-sensitive
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
